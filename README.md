# Fish-Weight-Prediction-and-Species-Classification
I utilized a linear regression model to make predictions on the weight of fishes. To interpret my model, I looked at the coefficient results to determine the relationship of weight and the other independent features. In addition, I also utilized a logistic regression model to classify the species of fish based on other independent features. To interpret my model, I calculated the odds ratio to determine, for example, how great the odds of a fish being a Pike is from an increase of the independent features.
